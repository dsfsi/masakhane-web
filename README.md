[**Masakhane**](https://www.masakhane.io/) meaning ‘we build together’, is a research effort for machine translation for African languages which is open source and online. So far, the community has built translation models based on [Joey NMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt) for over 38 African languages. As such, **Masakhane Web** is a platform that aims to host the already trained models from the community and allow contributions from users to create new data for retraining. The objective of this web application is to provide access to an open-source platform that makes available relatively accurate translations for languages across Africa. If you can't find your language and/or would like to train your own machine translation model in your language, see https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt on how you can contribute.


**Disclaimer:** This system is for research purposes only and should be taken as work in progress. None of the trained models are suitable for production usage.

## Options

-  *Can't see your language as one of the supported languages: Visit [Masakhane:Building your first machine translation model](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt#building-your-first-machine-translation-model) to learn more about how you can train a model for your language.*

-  *I have an idea or a new feature: Create a new issue first, assign it to yourself and then fork the repo*

-  *I want to help in improving the accuracy of the models: Check out below on how you can reach out to us*
