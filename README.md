[**Masakhane**](https://www.masakhane.io/) meaning ‘we build together’,  is a research effort for machine translation for African languages which is open source and online. So far, the community has built translation models based on [Joey NMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt) for over 38 African languages. As such, **Masakhane Web** is a platform that aims to host the already trained models from the community and allow contributions from users to create new data for retraining. The objective of this web application is to provide access to an open-source platform that makes available relatively accurate translations for languages across Africa. If you can't find your language and/or would like to train your own machine translation model in your language, see https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt on how you can contribute.
   

**Disclaimer:**  This system is for research purposes only and should be taken as work in progress. None of the trained models are suitable for production usage.

## How to run

### As a stand alone app 

#### Backend 
- run the app :
    - move to the server directory : `cd src/server/`
    - Install required packages 
        -  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - `export FLASK_APP=core/__init__.py`
    - `export FLASK_ENV=development`
    - `python manage.py run`

Note: The stand alone app uses sqlite as db instead of postgreSQL like our live app, you then need to run the command below to create and initialize the datbase. 

- Create table relations
    - `python manage.py create_db`
- Add language 
    - `python manage.py add_language en-sw-JW300`
- Remove language
    - `python manage.py remove_language en-sw-JW300`
- Check available languages
    - `python manage.py all_languages`
- Update known languages 
    - `curl --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/update'`
- Run tests
    - `python manage.py tests`

You can check content saved in the dabase using the code below (move to `src/server/core/` and run `python`):

```python
import sqlite3, os

conn = sqlite3.connect("masakhane.db")
c = conn.cursor()

for row in c.execute('SELECT * FROM feedback'):
    print(row)

for row in c.execute('SELECT * FROM language'):
    print(row)
```

#### Frontend 
- install the following: \
    - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)


- To run:
    - move to the client directory : `cd src/client/` 
    - run `npm install`
    - run `npm i webpack webpack-cli --legacy-peer-deps`
    - run `npm i @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader`
    - run `npm run develop`


This runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Using Docker (Prefered)

The better way to run the app is to use Docker, which will take care of running both the `frontend` and `backend` easily.

#### Install Docker and Docker-compose 

Run the following command to check if you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed in your computer :
    - `docker --version`
    - `docker-compose --version`

If you get the information about the version and not an error you can skeep the details below and just to the Using Docker section. 

- Docker : `https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/`
- Docker-compose : `https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/`

To make sure that it is well installed you can run the code above to check the version of the installed `docker` and `docker-compose`

#### Run the App

- run the app 
    * `docker-compose up -d --build` from the root project. 
- shutdown the app
    * `docker-compose down` 

- check the database
    * `docker-compose exec db psql --username=masakhane --dbname=masakhane`
        * list databases`\l`
        * connect to the masakhane database`\c masakhane`
        * list relations `\dt`
        * to quit `\q`
        * to see saved information in a relation `select * from language;`
        or 
        * to see feedbacks in a relation `select * from feedback;`

#### Add, Delete and Update supported languages  
- check the available models in memory `docker-compose exec api python manage.py all_languages`

- add a new language, 
    - e.g English-Swahili (note: we are using JW300 shortform) `docker-compose  exec api python manage.py add_language en-sw-JW300`
    - (English-Yoruba) `docker-compose  exec api python manage.py add_language en-yo-`
- delete a language `docker-compose  exec api python manage.py remove_language en-sw-JW300`
- run this on the production server to update the models `curl --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/update'`
- Run tests
    - `docker-compose  exec api python manage.py tests`

## Options
- *Can't see your language as one of the supported languages: Visit [Masakhane:Building your first machine translation model](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-mt#building-your-first-machine-translation-model) to learn more about how you can train a model for your language.*
- *I have an idea or a new feature: Create a new issue first, assign it to yourself and then fork the repo*
